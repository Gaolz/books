一：How to be a Wizard Programmer
  1. Ask question (不要害怕(羞于)问问题)
  2. 解决同事遇到的问题
  3. **无论如何**也要把问题弄明白
  4. **铭言：** Right, this is why they pay a human with a brain(me!!!) who can inestigate and learn

二：Learn one thing at a time
  1. Pick one small thing that will help with my problem
  2. Make sure I understand it pretty well(implement something very small with the new thing to test my understanding.)
  3. celebrate & repeat
